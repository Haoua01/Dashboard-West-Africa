    Class to calculate various indicators, including ISIBF and demographic indicators.

    Attributes:
        agency_counts (dict): A dictionary containing the number of agencies per region.
        neighbors (dict): A dictionary containing distances to neighboring regions.
        population (dict): A dictionary containing the population of each region.
        alpha (float): Parameter for the ISIBF calculation.
