# Financial Inclusion Mapping in Sub-Saharan Africa 

## Overview

My name is Haoua BEN ALI ABBO.
I am currently pursuing a Master's degree (M2) in a dual program between **Université Paris Dauphine** and **Télécom Paris**, where I am working towards both a Master's and an engineering diploma. As part of my studies, I am completing a work-study program at the **Institut Louis Bachelier**, focusing on **financial inclusion** in the **Sub-Saharan African region**.

## Project

My project has a dual purpose, involving:
- My work at the **Digital Finance Chair** within the institute.
- The **Master's thesis** I am required to complete to validate my Master's degree.

### Objectives

The core of my work is to create a **map of banking and non-banking infrastructure** across the Sub-Saharan African region. Specifically, I am analyzing the various actors providing financial services. The goal is to model the relationship between **access to these equipments** and the **economic development** of the region.
The model will involve :
- a cartography of the locations of the different financial services involving mainly **bank branches**, **mobile money outlets** and **microfinance agencies**;
- an analysis of the impact of **opening or closing a service** in the territory;
- an **econometric study** of the causal link between access to the equipments and economic develepment.
- a study of the impact of closing/opening a branch in a given area for the access.  

## Call for Collaboration

I am reaching out to request **documentation and data** to support my study on this topic. 
I will be needing :
- data on the location of the services
- data on the demographics and geographic characteristics of the countries
- documentation on financial inclusion related works in the topic.
